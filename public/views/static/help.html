        	What costs apply when changing a booking?

        	<p>
        		To change your booking details you pay a rebooking fee and a handling charge, depending on the type of ticket. If you rebook in a higher booking class you will also have to pay the difference between the original fare and the new one. As a general rule, you may rebook your ticket in the same booking class or a higher one â€“ provided there are still seats available.
